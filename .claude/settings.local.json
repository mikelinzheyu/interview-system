Updated the parser to:\n\n1. Handle ''message'' events from Dify Chat API (in addition to ''agent_message'')\n2. Properly extract conversation_id and message_id from event data\n3. Continue to support other event formats for backwards compatibility\n\nTesting Results:\n- API endpoint successfully returns streaming Dify Chat API responses\n- Real conversation IDs (UUIDs) are being generated and tracked\n- Content quality is high with comprehensive AI-generated explanations\n- Streaming works reliably without timeouts or content truncation\n- Backend logs confirm proper workflow routing and API integration\n\nFiles Modified:\n- backend/services/chatWorkflowService.js: Updated event parser\n\nThe Chat API integration is now fully functional and ready for production use.\nThe \"AI问答\" (AI Q&A) feature in the community forum posts now returns real,\ncomprehensive responses from Dify instead of mock data.\n\n🤖 Generated with Claude Code\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
